# Bivariate Kernel Density Estimation

## Introduction

Bivariate kernel density estimation is a statistical method used to estimate the probability density function of a two-dimensional random variable. It extends the concept of univariate kernel density estimation to higher dimensions, allowing for the visualization and analysis of the joint distribution of two variables.

The Botev method, introduced by Zdravko Botev, is a specific approach to bivariate kernel density estimation that aims to improve accuracy and computational efficiency compared to other methods.

## Botev Method Overview

The Botev method for bivariate kernel density estimation involves the following key steps:

1. **Data Preparation:** Begin by preparing your data, which consists of pairs of observations from the two variables of interest.

2. **Bandwidth Selection:** Choose an appropriate bandwidth parameter, which determines the smoothness of the estimated density. The Botev method employs a data-driven approach to automatically select an optimal bandwidth based on the input data.

3. **Kernel Function:** Select a kernel function, which determines the shape of the kernel used to smooth the data. Common choices include Gaussian, Epanechnikov, and uniform kernels.

4. **Density Estimation:** Use the selected kernel function and bandwidth to estimate the density at each point in the two-dimensional space defined by the range of the two variables. This involves calculating the kernel density estimate for each observation pair and summing them to obtain the overall density estimate.

5. **Normalization:** Normalize the density estimate to ensure that it integrates to unity over the entire two-dimensional space. This step is essential for obtaining a valid probability density function.

6. **Optional: Visualization:** Visualize the estimated density using contour plots, heatmaps, or other graphical representations to gain insights into the joint distribution of the two variables.

## Code Example

## Conclusion

Bivariate kernel density estimation with the Botev method is a powerful technique for analyzing the joint distribution of two variables. By estimating the probability density function in two dimensions, it provides valuable insights into the relationship between the variables and can be used for various statistical and machine learning.
