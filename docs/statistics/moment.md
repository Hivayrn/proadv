# Skewness Function

Return the sample `skewness` of a data set. For normally distributed data, the skewness should be about zero. For unimodal continuous distributions, a skewness value greater than zero means that there is more weight in the right tail of the distribution. The function `skewtest` can be used to determine if the skewness value is close enough to zero, statistically speaking.
