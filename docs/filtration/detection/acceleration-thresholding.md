# Acceleration Thresholding (AT)

The Acceleration Thresholding (AT) method is a traditional approach to spike detection and replacement, characterized by two distinct phases: one targeting negative acceleration and the other positive accelerations. 

In each phase, the algorithm iterates through the data multiple times, examining each data point to ensure compliance with the acceleration criterion and magnitude threshold. This iterative process guarantees thorough spike detection and replacement.
