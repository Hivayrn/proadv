# Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV)


### Introduction

An Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter (ADV) is a non-intrusive instrument widely used for measuring the velocity of fluids, typically water. It utilizes the Doppler shift principle, where the frequency of sound waves changes slightly when reflected off moving particles within the fluid. By analyzing this frequency shift, the ADV can determine the velocity of the particles and consequently the flow velocity of the fluid itself.

ADVs offer several advantages over other flow measurement techniques:

- **Minimally intrusive**: While they have a small sampling volume located approximately 5 cm below the instrument, they do not require direct contact with the bulk flow, minimizing flow disturbances and allowing for measurements in sensitive environments.
- **High-resolution**: They provide precise measurements of three-dimensional velocity components with high spatial and temporal resolution.
- **Versatility**: They can be deployed in various aquatic environments, from shallow streams to deep oceans.
