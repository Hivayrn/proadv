def kurtosis(x):
    """
    Compute the kurtosis of a dataset.

 Kurtosis is a measure of the "tailedness" of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable.
    This function calculates kurtosis using the Pearson method, which is the standardized fourth central moment.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        An array containing the data points. The array will be flattened if it is not already 1-D.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The kurtosis of the dataset. If the input contains NaNs, the function will return NaN.

    Notes
    -----
    This function converts the input array to a NumPy array, calculates the mean and standard deviation of the data,
    computes the fourth central moment, and then standardizes it to find the kurtosis.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> data = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]
    >>> kurtosis(data)
    out: 2.2

    # Convert data to a numpy array

    # Calculate the standard deviation
    standard_dev = desc.standard_deviation(x)

    # Calculate the fourth central moment
    fourth_moment = desc.mean((x - average) ** 4)

    # Standardize the fourth moment
    standardized_moment = fourth_moment / standard_dev ** 4

    return standardized_moment  # Returns the standardized moment which basically is kurtosis
